# Programming challenges:

# Code me if you can

1. [Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_computer) computer emulator
   * inspired by a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686)
   * start from NAND gate
   * end with a Pong running on the system

2. A liquid maze solver
   * floodfill using real liquid
   * implement simple 2d liquid physics
   * optimize it to run in realtime
   * make simulation look nice

3. A private chat webapp
   * use end to end encryption

4. A raytracer
   * inspired by [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io)
   * use GPU (compute shaders, DXR)

5. A chess agent
   * use less then 1024 tokens and maximum 256MB memory
   * inspuired by [Sebastian Lague challange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58)
   * write a few agents and let them play
  
6. A DLNA server
   * reverse-engineer existing solutions using Wireshark

7. A custom malloc 
   * implement your own malloc
  
8. A CHIP-8 emulator
   * really good place to start when embarking on the emulator journey
   * only ~40 simple instructions to implement
   * well documented [design](https://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
   * easily defined graphics (you can quickly visualize the progress!)
   * lots of [games](https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive) to test on

9. A micromouse agent
    * inspired by popular [micromouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) competition
    * write an agent to navigate a robot through a undiscovered maze

10. An voxel playground
    * inspired by [Teardown](https://teardowngame.com)
    * use only cubes
    * use only procedural texture

11. An online ASCII editor
    * write an online ascii char editor similar to [asciiflow](https://asciiflow.com/), but much more intuitive

13. A deep learning network for 2d racing game
    * generate random cyclick track
    * implement simple 2d driving model
    * implement simple 2d sensor model
    * use deep learning to find quickest agent to complete the track

14. A distributed [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage)
    * use consistent hashing

15. A programming language
    * design a simple programming language based on vector operations (SIMD)
    * implement a lexer
    * implement a recursive-descent parser
    * use a LLVM backend

16. A NES emulator
